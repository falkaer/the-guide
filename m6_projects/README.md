# 👨🏼‍💻🧬 Projects
If you are using this material for a course, a project is a good way to put in to practice
all of the various tools, methods and concepts we have looked at previously.
This section will get into what makes for a good project in either a course context.

This is where you get to play!

You can either write your own proposal, which is hopefully relevant to what you normally work
with/are interested in, or you can get some inspiration from [the list][14].

## What makes for a good real-time project?
Below you will find a few questions to ask yourself when determining either how to write your own
proposal or picking a pre-existing one.

* Which concepts from the previously seen material do you think are relevant to your project and why?
* Can the system eventually (end goal) take in sensor data, such as images from a camera or sound
from a microphone, and keep a real-time processing rate?
* Can the system be manipulated by a user through a GUI?
* Can the system be optimized by preprocessing your data?
* How do you adapt to your chosen/available platform?
* Which libraries are available for this problem?
* How fast can you get to your minimum viable product?
* Which steps would you take from there and why?
* How did you determine which parts of your system to optimize?
* Is there room to add more features to your system?

## How to create real time systems

* Start with a simple prototype.
* Identify your components.
* Create your first prototype as a single threaded correct implementation.
* Start with simple, reproducible data. If you are working with sound, load a single file.
* Implement testing (preferably automated) to avoid any regressions. Regressions are likely to occur
when optimizing.
* Start ingesting real-time data from a sensor or getting user interaction.
* Profile and optimize in a loop.
* Optionally, add more features and optimize.
* Optionally, if you are using machine learning, is there anything you could do to optmize your
model as a preprocessing step?

## Components
Given how easy it is to include libraries in Rust projects, Rust has a relatively small standard
library. Instead a de-facto standard library emerges through a pseudo-democratic process driven
by usage statistics and GitHub stars. A list of these de-facto standard crates can be
found on the [blessed][0] website.

Additionally, there's a set of overview sites tracking the state of Rust's nascent ecosystem.
These have the "Arewe____yet" form. Examples like [Arewelearningyet][1] can also be found
in [AreWeRustYet][2].
