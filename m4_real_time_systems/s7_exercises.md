# 👨🏼‍💻 Exercises
m4::e0 and m4::e1 combined were used as a hand-in in the course version.
m4::e0 is a gentle starting point for architectural analysis and also serves
as a template which can serve as a starting point for projects. m2::e1 seeks
to bridge the gap between what has been taught so far and what is in your
own area of interest.

## m4::e0 - Architectural Analysis
Describe the base architecture of the egui-winit-wgpu template. Found in
```m2_concurrency::code::egui-winit-wgpu-template``` or [online][0].

Which elements are in play?  
Who owns what data?  
Think back to what you have learned in this and the previous module.  
Use words and diagrams!  

## 🧬 m4::e1 - Interpretation
Pick items worth a total of 3 points or more, write an interpretation of each
item of at least 10 times the number of points lines. So an item worth 2 points
requires a 20 line description.

Suggestions for things to talk about:

* A description of the proposed solution
* Which elements you have learned about in ```m1``` and ```m2``` are at play?
* What performance implications result from the item?
* What needs to be bottlenecked for this technique to be relevant (if it is an optimization technique)
* What will likely be the bottleneck after this technique has been implemented?
* What is the weakness of the method/design?
* In which cases would the proposed method/design be less useful?

You don't need to be correct, in many cases you can't be without profiling. The point is the process of putting
into words analysis from a systems programming perspective.
